## About the Project

**Modern Reads** is a static online bookstore landing page designed to showcase a curated collection of books focused on personal growth, productivity, and wealth. This project demonstrates strong foundational skills in front-end web development, specifically using **HTML** and **CSS** to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing user interface.

The goal of this project was to create a professional-looking, single-page website that is easy to navigate and highlights key design principles such as a clear hierarchy, a consistent color palette, and smooth animations.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: A sticky header with a brand logo, search bar, and "My Library" call-to-action button.
- **Hero Section**: An engaging introductory section with a prominent headline, a brief description, and a featured book highlighted as the "Librarian's pick."
- **Book Grid**: A dynamic grid layout for displaying book cards.
- **Card-based UI**: Each book is presented in a clean, interactive card showing the book's title, author, price, and an "Add" button.
- **Subtle Animations**: Hover effects and a floating animation on the featured book card to enhance user engagement.
- **Semantic HTML**: The structure is built using modern, semantic HTML5 tags for better accessibility and search engine optimization.
- **Custom CSS Variables**: The stylesheet uses CSS variables for easy maintenance and consistent theming.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the fundamental structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For all styling, layout, and animations. This includes the use of Flexbox, CSS Grid, and custom properties (variables).
- **Google Fonts**: `Inter` and `Playfair Display` for a professional and modern typography design.
